## Achieving the same setupðŸ““

### ðŸ”· Changing Default Shell

I am using zsh shell as my default shell. This can be done by the chsh command where chsh stands for change shell

`chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh`

### ðŸ”· Setting App Switching to current tab only

This can be done by

`gsettings set org.gnome.shell.app-switcher current-workspace-only true`

### ðŸ”· Removing Snaps (If you use Ubuntu)

It's just a personal preference, but I don't like snaps. To remove them from Ubuntu, I used

`sudo apt remove snapd`  
`sudo umount /dev/loop*`  
`sudo rm -rf /snap`  
`sudo rm -rf /var/lib/snapd`  
`sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/snap`
