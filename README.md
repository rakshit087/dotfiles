## Notes on Using UbuntuðŸ““

### ðŸ”· Changing Default Shell
I am using fish shell as my default shell. This can be done by the chsh command where chsh stands for change shell

`chsh -s /usr/bin/fish`

### ðŸ”· Removing Snaps
It's just a personal preference, but I don't like snaps. To remove them from Ubuntu, I used

`sudo apt remove snapd`  
`sudo umount /dev/loop*`  
`sudo rm -rf /snap`  
`sudo rm -rf /var/lib/snapd`  
`sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/snap`

### ðŸ”· Loading dconf Configurations
Gnome uses dconf for configurations. Dconf stores its data in a binary format rather than plain text files.
To dump dconf data I used:

`dconf dump / > ~/.config/dconf/user.conf`

This .config file can be loaded by

`dconf load / < ~/.config/dconf/user.conf`

### ðŸ”· Setting App Switching to current tab only
This can be done by

`gsettings set org.gnome.shell.app-switcher current-workspace-only true`

I had dumped this to user.conf too.
